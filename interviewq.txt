------------------------------------------------Node JS------------------------------------------------------

Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript engine used for executing JavaScript code outside the browser. 
It is normally used to build the backend of the application and is highly scalable.

What are promises in Node.js?
A promise is basically an advancement of callbacks in NodeJS. In other words, a promise is a JavaScript object which is used to handle 
all the asynchronous data operations. While developing an application you may encounter that you are using a lot of nested callback functions 
which causes a problem of callback hell. Promises solve this problem of callback hell.


myPromise
  .then((result) => {
    // Handle success
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // Handle error
  });

const http = require('http');

// Create a server object
http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.write('Hello World!'); 
    res.end();
}).listen(3000);


How to import a module in Node.js?

We use the require module to import the External libraries in Node.js.
 The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation.
importing a module in Node.js allows you to use code from other files or external libraries. Let’s break it down:

Core Modules:
Node.js has built-in modules like http, fs, and path.
You can load them using require():
JavaScript

const http = require('http');
http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' });
  res.write('Welcome to this page!');
  res.end();
}).listen(3000);


Local Modules:
Create your own modules locally.

Third-Party Modules:
Install external modules via npm (Node Package Manager).
Import them similarly using require().
Example: Importing Mongoose (a popular database library):
JavaScript

import mongoose from 'mongoose';
console.log(mongoose.version); // 5.9.19

REPL, which stands for Read Eval Print Loop, is an interactive programming environment in Node.js. 

REPL allows you to execute JavaScript code in real-time.
It reads your input, evaluates it, prints the result, and then waits for more input.

The event loop in Node.js is a mechanism that allows it to handle multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently within a single thread. 
It continuously listens for events and executes associated callback functions.

Node.js handles many tasks simultaneously using its single thread.
When you ask it to read a file or make a network request, Node.js doesn’t wait around.
It sends the task away and says, “I’ll let you know when it’s done!”

What is middleware?
Middleware is the function that works between the request and the response cycle. 
Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller sends the response.

useCases 
Handle authentication, logging, or error handling.

npm
npm (Node Package Manager) is the default package manager for Node.js. It allows developers to discover, share, and reuse code packages easily. 

module
In Node.js Application, a Module can be considered as a block of code that provide a simple or complex functionality that can communicate with external application.
 Modules can be organized in a single file or a collection of multiple files/folders.
 Modules are useful because of their reusability and ability to reduce the complexity of code into smaller pieces. 
Some examples of modules are. http, fs, os, path, etc

Node.js handles concurrency by using asynchronous, non-blocking operations. Instead of waiting for one task to complete before starting the next,
 it can initiate multiple tasks and continue processing while waiting for them to finish, all within a single thread.

----------------------------------------------MongoDB-------------------------------------------

NoSQL stands for "Not Only SQL". NoSQL is a type of database that can handle and sort all type of unstructured, messy and complicated data.

NoSQL database can be classified as 4 basic types:

Key value store NoSQL database
Document store NoSQL database
Column store NoSQL database
Graph base NoSQL databse

MongoDB is better than other SQL databases because it allows a highly flexible and scalable document structure.

For example:

One data document in MongoDB can have five columns and the other one in the same collection can have ten columns.
MongoDB database are faster than SQL databases due to efficient indexing and storage techniques.

MongoDb is the best NoSQL database because, it is:

Document Oriented

Rich Query language

High Performance

Highly Available

Easily Scalable

 The _id value 666a84dfb2a233e80a6e0d32 is a hexadecimal representation of a unique identifier in MongoDB. Let’s break it down:

Timestamp: The first 8 characters (666a84df) represent the timestamp when the document was created.
Machine Identifier: The next 6 characters (b2a233) identify the machine where MongoDB is running.
Process ID: The following 4 characters (e80a) indicate the process generating the _id.
Random Counter: The last 6 characters (6e0d32) provide a unique value to prevent collisions


BSON stands for Binary JSON. It’s a binary file format used to store serialized JSON documents in a binary-encoded format. Developed by MongoDB in 2009, BSON retains the structure of JSON but adds some distinct features:

Binary Encoding: Unlike human-readable JSON, BSON is binary-encoded, making it more efficient for machines to parse.
Data Types: BSON supports additional data types beyond what JSON offers, including dates and binary data.
Usage: It’s commonly used in MongoDB databases to represent documents.

What are Indexes in MongoDB?
In MondoDB, Indexes are used to execute query efficiently. Without indexes, MongoDB must perform a collection scan,
 i.e. scan every document in a collection, to select those documents that match the query statement.

What is a Namespace in MongoDB?
Namespace is a concatenation of the database name and the collection name.
 If an appropriate index exists for a query, MongoDB can use the index to limit the number of documents it must inspect.
