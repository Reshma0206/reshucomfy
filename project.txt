“Comfy-Store” is an e-commerce website where I sell furniture items such as chairs, tables, beds, and lamps. Here’s an overview of my HomeLayout page:

Header and Navbar:
The header component includes two links: one for creating an account (registration) and another for logging in.
When users click the “Create an Account” button, it opens the registration page.
On the registration page, I’ve included input fields for username, email, and password. I’ve also added validations,
 such as requiring passwords to be at least 8 characters long and validating email addresses.
After successful registration, users can log in directly from the registration form. The login link redirects them to the login page.

Login Page:
Login Page Elements:
The login page contains input fields for email and password.
If a user tries to log in with an unregistered email, a toast message appears, indicating that the email is not registered.
Successful Login:
Upon successful login:
Users are redirected back to the home page.
The login page also includes a link to the registration page. If the email is not registered, users can click this link to register.
Additionally, there’s a link for resetting the password, although the backend implementation for this feature is pending 
(such as sending a password reset email).

---Registeration 

Frontend (React) Part:
I use the useState() hook to store the username, email, and password entered by the user.
When the user submits the form, I send this data via an axios.post request to my MongoDB database.
If registration is successful, I display a toast message indicating that account created successfully. Then, I navigate to the login page.

Backend (Node.js) Part (userController.jsx):
I retrieve form details from req.body.
Using the findOne method, I check if the user is already registered.
If the user is registered, I display a message saying that the user already exists.
If the user is not registered, I save their details in the database after hashing the password for security.
The server responds with a message: “Account created successfully.”
If any errors occur during data posting, I catch them in my catch block and display an error message for registration.

---Login

Storing User Input:
On the login page, you use the useState() hook to store the email and password entered by the user.
When the user submits the login form, you send this data to your MongoDB database using an axios.post request.

Successful Login Flow:
If the user logs in successfully:
Display a toast message indicating successful login.
Navigate to the login page.
You retrieve form details from req.body.

Checking User Registration:
You use the findOne method to check if the user is already registered.
If the user is not registered, the server responds with a message saying “Email is not registered.”

Password Validation:
If the user is registered, you compare the password they entered with the hashed password stored in the database during registration.
If the passwords match, you generate an authentication token.
The server responds with a message confirming successful login and sends the user details along with the token.


---Header.jsx

“In my header page, I include the user’s name. This serves as a validation:
 if there is a token, I display a logout button and a friendly greeting with the user’s name.
 If there is no token, it means the user is not logged in, and I show a link to register and log in.”

---navbar.jsx
--Hero.jsx

“Here, I have included two <div> elements. In one <div> element, I have included an <h1> heading, a paragraph (<p>), and a link to my products page.
 In the other <div> element, I have included carousel images. These images are imported from my assets folder and displayed as a carousel.”


Clicking on a product in the productGrid.jsx file:

When the user clicks on a product card in the productGrid.jsx file, the Link component updates the URL to include the product.id 
as a parameter (e.g., /products/123).
This URL change triggers the routing system to look for a matching route, which it finds in the app.jsx file.
Rendering the SingleProduct component:

The routing system matches the URL pattern "/products/:id" and renders the SingleProduct component.
Before rendering the SingleProduct component, the loader function (exported from singleproduct.jsx) is called.
Fetching the individual product data:

The loader function receives the params object, which contains the id parameter from the URL (e.g., { id: '123' }).
The loader function then uses the params.id to make a request to the /products/${params.id} endpoint using the customFetch function.
The response from the API call is returned as the product property in the loader function's return object.
Rendering the SingleProduct component with the fetched data:

The routing system takes the data returned from the loader function and passes it to the SingleProduct component as a prop (likely named product).
The SingleProduct component can then use this product data to render the individual product page.

---featuredProducts.jsx

I have included featured products like sample products. 
I have included the image, title of the product, and price in a link component.
 When I click on a particular product, it will redirect to my SingleProduct.jsx file where I have included the details of each product.

---products.jsx 

In my Products.jsx file, I have included the total number of products, which I have fetched from the URL. 
I have also added two buttons: one for representing products in a grid layout, and the other for displaying my products in a list layout.
 If I select the grid button, my ProductGrid component will re-render. If I click on the list button, my ProductList component will re-render.


---singleProduct.jsx file 

When I click on a particular card, it will re-render my SingleProduct component.
 In this component, I have included more details about my product, such as the title, company name, price, and description of the product.
 I have also included different colors that the product is available in. 
I have used a select option so the user can choose how many of that particular product they want, up to 20. Finally,
 I have included an "Add to Cart" button, which, when clicked, will trigger the addToCartHandler function. 
This function will call the addToCart function, where I have implemented the logic in the CartContext component.

----addToCart() both frontend and backed=nd part


CartContext.jsx:

The addToCart function is responsible for adding a product to the cart.
It first checks if the product already exists in the cart by searching for a matching productID and productColor.
If the product already exists in the cart, it updates the amount of the existing product in the cart.
If the product doesn't exist in the cart, it creates a new cart item with the product details and adds it to the cart.
After adding or updating the product in the cart, it calls the calculateCartTotals function to update the total cost and total number of items in the cart.
If the operation is successful, it shows a success message using the toast library. Otherwise, it shows an error message.

CartController.jsx:

The router.post("/cart/products", ...) route handles the request to add a product to the cart.
It first checks if the product already exists in the cart by searching for a matching userid, productID, and productColor.
If the product already exists in the cart, it updates the amount of the existing product in the cart.
If the product doesn't exist in the cart, it creates a new cart item with the product details and saves it to the database.
It then sends a response back to the client, indicating the success or failure of the operation.

Data Handling and Updating:

When the user clicks the "Add to Cart" button in the SingleProduct component, the addToCart function in the CartContext is called with the product details.
The addToCart function in the CartContext component checks if the product already exists in the cart.
 If it does, it updates the amount of the existing product. If it doesn't, it creates a new cart item and adds it to the cart.
The addToCart function in the CartContext component then calls the calculateCartTotals function to update the total cost
 and total number of items in the cart.
The addToCart function in the CartContext component then sends a request to the server using the axios.post method, 
passing the product details to the /cart/products route in the CartController.jsx file.
The router.post("/cart/products", ...) route in the CartController.jsx file receives the product details, 
checks if the product already exists in the cart, and updates the amount or creates a new cart item accordingly.
The CartController.jsx file then sends a response back to the client, indicating the success or failure of the operation.
The CartContext component receives the response from the server and updates the cartItems state accordingly, 
displaying a success or error message using the toast library.

----cartItem.jsx 


The CartItem component is responsible for rendering a single item in the user's shopping cart.
 It receives a cartItem prop, which contains all the necessary information about the product, such as the title, price, image, color, and amount.

Here's a breakdown of what the component does:

Image: It displays the product's image, which is fetched from the image property of the cartItem object.

Product Information: It displays the product's title, company name, and color. 
The title and company name are displayed in a capitalized format, and the color is displayed as a small badge with the corresponding color.

Amount: It provides a dropdown select input that allows the user to change the amount of the product they want to purchase.
 The options in the dropdown are generated using the generateAmountOptions utility function,
 which creates an array of numbers from 1 to the current amount plus 5.

Remove: It includes a "Remove" button that, when clicked, calls the removeFromCart function from the CartContext.
 This function removes the current cartItem from the cart.

Price: It displays the total price of the item, which is calculated by multiplying the product's price by the current amount.

The CartItem component uses the useContext hook to access the CartContext, which provides the necessary functions
 (removeFromCart and updateAmount) to manage the cart items.

---removeFromCart

CartContext.jsx:

The removeFromCart function is responsible for removing a product from the cart.
It first sends a DELETE request to the server using the axios.delete method, passing the userid, productID, and productColor of the product to be removed.
The setCartItems function is then called to update the cartItems state in the context. It filters out the item with the matching productID and productColor and updates the cartItems array.
After updating the cartItems, it calls the calculateCartTotals function to update the total cost and total number of items in the cart.
If the operation is successful, it shows an error message using the toast library.
If there's an error, it logs the error to the console.

CartController.jsx:

The router.delete("/cart/remove", ...) route handles the request to remove a product from the cart.
It receives the userid, productID, and productColor of the product to be removed in the request body.
It then uses the Cart.deleteOne method to delete the corresponding item from the cart in the database.
After deleting the item, it retrieves the updated list of cart items for the user and sends a response back to the client,
 indicating the success of the operation and providing the updated list of cart items.

Data Handling and Updating:

When the user clicks the "Remove" button in the CartItem component, the removeFromCart function in the CartContext is called with the product details.
The removeFromCart function in the CartContext component sends a DELETE request to the server using the axios.delete method, passing the userid, productID, and productColor of the product to be removed.
The router.delete("/cart/remove", ...) route in the CartController.jsx file receives the product details, 
deletes the corresponding item from the cart in the database, and sends a response back to the client with the updated list of cart items.
The CartContext component receives the response from the server and updates the cartItems state by filtering out the removed item.
 It also calls the calculateCartTotals function to update the total cost and total number of items in the cart.
The CartItem component, which is connected to the CartContext through the useContext hook, re-renders with the updated cart items, 
displaying the changes to the user.

The setCartItems function receives an arrow function as its argument, which takes the current value of the cartItems state as its parameter,
 currentCartItems.

CartContext.jsx:

The fetchCartItems function is responsible for fetching the user's cart items from the server.
It uses the axios.get method to send a GET request to the /getcartitems/:id route on the server, passing the user's _id as the parameter.
When the response is received, the setCartItems function is called to update the cartItems state in the context.
The calculateCartTotals function is also called to update the total cost and total number of items in the cart.
If there's an error, it logs the error to the console.
CartController.jsx:

The router.get("/getcartitems/:id", ...) route handles the request to fetch the user's cart items.
It receives the id (user's _id) as a parameter in the URL.
It then uses the Cart.find method to retrieve all the cart items for the given userid.
If the cart items are found, it sends a response back to the client with the success status,
 the message of "cart items fetched successfully", and the products (cart items).
If there's an error, it sends a response with the success status set to false and an error message.
Fetching Cart Items:
The fetchCartItems function is called in the useEffect hook in the CartContext.jsx file.
 This hook is used to fetch the user's cart items when the component mounts (i.e., when the user logs in).

The reason for fetching the cart items is to ensure that the front-end has the most up-to-date information about the user's cart.
 When the user adds a product to the cart, the front-end updates the cartItems state locally.
 However, to ensure that the cart state is consistent across the client and the server, the front-end needs to fetch the cart items from the server.

By fetching the cart items, the front-end can:

Populate the initial state of the cartItems with the data from the server.
Ensure that the cartItems state is in sync with the server-side data, even if the user has made changes to the cart from other devices or sessions.
Calculate the total cost and total number of items in the cart based on the complete set of cart items from the server.


 The reason for using the fetchCartItems function in both the CartContext.jsx and the Login.jsx files
 is to ensure that the user's cart is consistently updated across the application.

In the CartContext.jsx file:

The fetchCartItems function is used to fetch the user's cart items when the user logs in or when the CartContext component mounts.
This ensures that the cartItems state in the CartContext is initialized with the correct data from the server.
The useEffect hook in the CartContext.jsx file calls fetchCartItems when the component mounts, ensuring that the cart items are always up-to-date.
In the Login.jsx file:

After the user successfully logs in, the fetchCartItems function is called with the user's _id as the argument.
This is done to ensure that the cartItems state in the CartContext is updated with the latest cart data for the logged-in user.
The reason for calling fetchCartItems in both files is to maintain a consistent and reliable user experience.

Login Process: When the user logs in, the Login.jsx file is responsible for handling the login process. 
After a successful login, it's important to fetch the user's cart items and update the CartContext accordingly.
Component Initialization: The CartContext.jsx file is responsible for providing the cart-related state and functionality to the entire application.
 By calling fetchCartItems in the useEffect hook, the cart items are fetched and initialized when the CartContext component mounts, 
ensuring that the cart data is available throughout the application.
Calling fetchCartItems in both files ensures that the cart state is always up-to-date, 
regardless of whether the user is logging in, navigating to a different page, or performing any cart-related actions. 
This consistency helps provide a seamless user experience, where the cart data is always in sync with the server-side data.
