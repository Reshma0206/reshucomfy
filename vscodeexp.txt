---server/index.js

const express = require("express");: 
This line imports the Express.js framework, which simplifies building web applications in Node.js.

const mongoose = require("mongoose");:
Mongoose is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. It allows us to interact with MongoDB databases using JavaScript.
 Think of it as a bridge between our application and the database.

const cors = require("cors");: CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) middleware enables cross-origin requests between different domains. 
It’s essential for allowing our frontend (running on a different domain) to communicate with our backend server.

Creating an Express App
const app = express();: This initializes an Express application. We create an instance of the Express app, which we’ll configure with routes and middleware.

Middleware Setup:
app.use(cors());: This middleware enables Cross-Origin Resource Sharing, allowing requests from different origins (e.g., browsers) to access our server.
 Without this, browsers would block requests due to security restrictions.

app.use(express.json());: This middleware parses incoming JSON data from requests.
It translates the JSON message into something your server can understand.

magine a guest (browser) sends this JSON message:
JSON

{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 25
}

express.json() converts it to a JavaScript object:
JavaScript

{
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
}

app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));: This middleware parses URL-encoded data (e.g., form submissions).
 It’s useful for handling form data sent via POST requests.

express.urlencoded() translates from data  into an object
{
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25
  // Other fields...
}

Database Connection:
mongoose.connect("mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/reshmadatabase").then(() => { console.log("mongodb connected"); });: 
This line connects to a MongoDB database named “reshmadatabase” running locally on port 27017. When the connection is successful,
 it logs the message “mongodb connected.” Essentially, we’re telling our app where to find the database.


Routing and Controllers:
app.use("/api", userController);: This associates the “/api” route with the userController. 
In web development, routes define how different parts of our application respond to specific URLs.
 The userController likely contains logic related to user authentication, registration, etc.

app.use("/api", cartController);: Similarly, this associates the “/api” route with the cartController. 
The cartController probably handles operations related to shopping carts or orders.

Server Listening:
app.listen(5001, () => { console.log("Server running on port 5001"); });: 
This starts the server and makes it listen on port 5001.When someone accesses our app via a browser or API request, it hits this server. 
The callback function logs the message “Server running on port 5001.”


---models/User.js

Importing Dependencies:

const mongoose = require("mongoose");: We import the Mongoose library, which allows us to work with MongoDB databases using JavaScript. 
Mongoose provides an Object Data Modeling (ODM) layer, making it easier to define schemas and interact with data.

const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");: We import the bcrypt library, which helps us securely hash and compare passwords.
 Hashing passwords is crucial for user authentication.
Defining the User Schema:

UserSchema = new mongoose.Schema({ ... }): Here, we define a schema for our user data. 
A schema specifies the structure of a MongoDB document (similar to a table in relational databases).

username: A field for storing the user’s username. It’s marked as required, meaning every user document must have a username.
email: A field for the user’s email address. It’s also marked as required and unique, ensuring that each email is unique across all users.
password: A field for storing the user’s password. Again, it’s marked as required.


Creating the User Model:
User = mongoose.model("User", UserSchema): We create a model named “User” using the UserSchema. 
The model represents the collection of users in our MongoDB database. It provides methods for querying, creating, updating, and deleting user records.

Exporting the User Model:
module.exports = User: We export the User model so that other parts of our application (such as controllers or routes) can use it.


---controllers/userController.js


Importing Dependencies:
const express = require("express");: We import the Express.js framework, which simplifies building web applications in Node.js. 
Express provides tools for handling routes, middleware, and more.

const User = require("../models/Users");: We import the User model from the “…/models/Users” file.
 The model represents user data in our application.

const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");: We import the bcrypt library, which helps us securely hash and compare passwords.

const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");: We import the jsonwebtoken library for handling authentication tokens.

Creating an Express Router:
const router = express.Router();: We create an instance of an Express Router. A router allows us to define routes for our API.

---User Registration Route:
router.post("/register", async (req, res) => { ... }): We define a POST route for user registration (“/register”).
 When a client sends a POST request to this route, the following code executes:

const { username, email, password } = req.body;: We extract the username, email, and password from the request body sent by the client.

const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email });: We check if a user with the same email already exists in the database.
 If so, we return an error response.

const newUser = new User({ username, email, password });: If the user does not exist, we create a new User instance with the provided data.

await newUser.save();: We save the new user to the MongoDB database.

res.status(201).json({ success: true, message: "User registered successfully" });: If everything is successful,
 we return a success response with a status code of 201 (created).

Error Handling:
catch (error) { ... }: If any error occurs during the registration process (e.g., database connection issues), 
we return an error response with a status code of 500 (internal server error).

Exporting the Router:
module.exports = router;: We export the router so that it can be used in other parts of our application.


---User Login Route:
router.post("/login", async (req, res) => { ... }): This defines a POST route for user login (“/login”). 
When a client sends a POST request to this route, the following code executes:

Extracting Request Data:
const { email, password } = req.body;: We extract the email and password from the request body sent by the client.

Finding the User:
const user = await User.findOne({ email });: We search for a user with the provided email in our database.
If no user is found, we return an error response (status code 401) indicating “Invalid email or password.”

Password Validation:
const isValidPassword = await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password);:
 We compare the provided password with the hashed password stored in the database.
If the password is invalid, we return an error response (status code 401) indicating “Invalid password.”

Generating a JSON Web Token (JWT):
const token = await jwt.sign({ _id: user._id }, "HJSLDHFNSEUHVKJBG34523", { expiresIn: "7d" });

 If the user exists and the password is valid, we generate a JWT.
The JWT contains the user’s unique ID (_id) and expires after 7 days.

Returning the Response:
res.status(200).json({ ... });: We return a success response (status code 200) with the following data:
success: true: Indicates successful login.
message: "Login Successfully": A friendly message.
user: An object containing user details (excluding the password).
token: The generated JWT.

Personalization: The user badge helps personalize their experience (like saying, “Welcome, Alice!”).
Security: The token ensures they can access only what they’re allowed to (rides, features, etc.).

Error Handling:
catch (error) { ... }: If any error occurs during the login process (e.g., database connection issues), 
we log the error and return an error response (status code 500).

----cartController.jsx

Importing Dependencies:
const express = require("express");: This line imports the Express.js framework, which simplifies building web applications in Node.js.
const User = require("../models/Users");: It imports the User model from the Users module (presumably defined elsewhere in the project).
const bcrypt = require("bcrypt");: This line imports the bcrypt library, which is used for hashing passwords securely.
const jwt = require("jsonwebtoken");: It imports the jsonwebtoken library, which helps create and verify JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for authentication.
const Cart = require("../models/Cart");: This line imports the Cart model, which likely represents a user’s shopping cart.

Creating an Express Router:
const router = express.Router();: This creates an instance of an Express router, which allows us to define routes and their corresponding handlers.

Route Definition:
router.post("/cart/products", async (req, res) => {: This defines a route for handling HTTP POST requests to the path /cart/products.

async (req, res) => { ... }: This is an asynchronous function that handles the request and response objects.

Request Body Parsing:
const { cartID, title, company, price, image, productColor, amount } = req.body;: This line extracts specific properties from the request body
 (sent by the client) using destructuring. These properties likely represent details of a product to be added to the user’s cart.

Checking for Existing User:
const existingUser = await Cart.findOne({ ... });: This queries the Cart model to find an existing cart entry with the same properties
 (e.g., cartID, title, etc.). If found, it means the user already has this product in their cart.
If existingUser is truthy, the code returns a 400 status with a message indicating that the user already exists.

Creating a New Cart Entry:
const newUser = new Cart({ ... });: If no existing cart entry is found, this line creates a new Cart instance with the provided properties
 (e.g., cartID, title, etc.).

await newUser.save();: It saves the new cart entry to the database.

Sending Response:
res.status(201).json({ success: true, message: "User registered successfully" });: 
If everything is successful, the server responds with a 201 status (indicating resource creation) and a JSON object containing a success flag and a message.

Error Handling:
catch (error) { ... }: If any error occurs during the process (e.g., database connection issue), the server responds with a 500 status and an error message.

In summary, this code handles adding products to a user’s cart in an e-commerce application.
 It checks if the product already exists in the cart, creates a new cart entry if not, and sends an appropriate response back to the client.

-----------------------------FRONT END ----------------

---main.jsx

Importing Dependencies:
import React from 'react';: This line imports the React library, which is essential for building React applications.
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';: It imports the ReactDOM library, which provides methods for rendering React components into the DOM.
import App from './App.jsx';: This line imports the App component from a file named App.jsx.
 The App component is likely the root component of the application.
import './index.css';: It imports a CSS file named index.css, which is probably used for styling the application.

Root Element and Rendering:
ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(...): 
This line creates a root element (usually a <div> with an id of 'root') in the HTML document where the React application will be rendered.

The createRoot method is part of React’s concurrent mode and allows for asynchronous rendering.

Inside the render method, we wrap the App component with <React.StrictMode>. Strict mode helps identify potential issues during development.

Rendering the App Component:
<App />: This JSX expression represents the App component. It will be rendered inside the root element.
The App component likely contains the main structure of the application, including other components, routes, and logic.

Strict Mode:
<React.StrictMode>: This wrapper component enables strict mode for the entire application.
 It helps catch potential problems early and provides additional warnings during development.

Strict mode checks for deprecated features, side effects, and other issues.

---pages/About.jsx

The “About” component displays a simple UI with a heading(h1), a styled text, and a paragraph. 

---pages/Error.jsx

import { useRouteError, Link } from "react-router-dom";

This line imports two modules from the “react-router-dom” library:

useRouteError: A custom hook that provides information about route errors.
Link: A component used for creating navigation links within a React application.

const error = useRouteError();

The useRouteError hook is called to retrieve information about the current route error.
The error object contains details such as the error status (e.g., 404 for page not found).

Conditional Rendering Based on Error Status
if (error.status === 404) {
  // Return JSX for 404 error
} else {
  // Return alternative JSX for other errors
}

If the error status is 404 (page not found), the component returns a specific JSX structure.
Otherwise, it returns an alternative JSX structure.

---pages/HomeLayout.jsx

import { Outlet, useNavigation } from "react-router-dom";
import { Header, Navbar, Loading } from "../components";

Outlet: A special component provided by React Router that renders child routes.
useNavigation: A custom hook from React Router that provides information about the current navigation state.

const navigation = useNavigation();
const isPageLoading = navigation.state === "loading";

The useNavigation hook is called to retrieve information about the current navigation state.
The navigation object contains properties related to the navigation state.
The isPageLoading variable is set to true if the navigation state is “loading,” indicating that the page content is still being fetched.

What is <Outlet />?
The <Outlet /> is a special component provided by React Router.
It acts as a placeholder for rendering child routes within a parent route.
When you define nested routes (child routes) in your application, the <Outlet /> is where those child routes will be rendered.
Use of <Outlet />:
In your code, the <Outlet /> component is placed inside the HomeLayout component.
It indicates that any child routes defined for the HomeLayout 

---pages/index.js

Now, the index.jsx file serves as an entry point or a central hub for exporting and re-exporting components. 
It allows us to bundle all our components together and make them accessible from a single location. 
Think of it as a directory signpost that says, “Hey, here are all the components you can use!”

---pages/Landing.jsx

What Is useLoaderData?
useLoaderData is a special function (or tool) that helps us get data when our web page loads.
It’s like asking a friend to fetch your favorite toy from the toy store before you even arrive there!

How Does It Work?
When our web page loads (like when you open a website), this function goes behind the scenes and gets some data for us.
That data could be anything—like a list of products, user information, or even cute cat pictures!

Why Do We Use It?
Well, sometimes we need certain information right away when our page starts.
Instead of waiting around, we use useLoaderData to grab that info in advance.
It’s like having your homework ready before the teacher even asks for it!

---Login.jsx

POST REQUEST

What is a POST request?
A POST request is used to add new data to the backend of a web application.
It’s similar to a GET request (which retrieves data), but instead of using axios.get, we use axios.post.

How does it work?
We specify the target URL where we want to send data.
We create an object containing the data we want to send in the request body.
For example, when logging into Facebook, we fill in the login form and send the details (like email and password) to the server using a POST request.

Axios POST Syntax:
axios.post(url, data[, config])

url: The server path where we send the request (as a string).
data: An object containing the request body data.
config: Additional configuration (e.g., headers, authorization) in object format.

Remember, Axios simplifies handling HTTP requests, making it easier to communicate with servers!

import { useState } from "react";
This line imports the useState hook from the React library.
The useState hook allows us to manage state (such as variables) within functional components.

import axios from "axios";
This line imports the Axios library, which is commonly used for making HTTP requests (e.g., fetching data from a server).

import { toast } from "react-toastify";
This line imports the toast function from the react-toastify library.
The toast function is used to display notifications (e.g., success or error messages) to the user.

value={email}: Binds the input value to the email state variable.
onChange={(e) => setEmail(e.target.value)}: Updates the email state when the user types in the input field.

What Is Axios?
Axios is like a messenger that helps our web application talk to a server.
Imagine you want to order food from a restaurant. Axios is the waiter who takes your order (HTTP request) and brings back the food (server response).

Why Do We Use Axios?
Axios makes it easy to send requests (like logging in or fetching data) from our app to a server.
It handles all the communication details, like making sure the order reaches the kitchen (server) and bringing back the food (response data).

What Is await?
Think of await as waiting for your food to arrive.
When we use await, our code pauses until Axios gets the server response.
It’s like saying, “Hold on, let me get the food first!”

Putting It Together:
In your code, you’re sending a login request (with email and password) to the server using Axios.
The await ensures that we wait for the server to respond before moving on.
Once we get the response, we can handle it (like showing a success message or handling errors).

Remember, Axios helps our app talk to the server, and await makes sure we get the response before continuing

---pages/SingleProduct.jsx

const SingleProduct = () => { ... }:
This defines a functional component named SingleProduct.
Functional components are a way to create reusable UI elements in React.

const { product } = useLoaderData();:
This line uses the useLoaderData hook provided by React Router.
It fetches data for the component before rendering, improving performance and preventing empty states.
The fetched data is destructured, and the product object is extracted.

const { image, title, price, description, colors, company } = product.attributes;:
This line further destructures the product object.
It extracts specific properties like image, title, price, description, colors, and company.

const dollarsAmount = formatPrice(price);:
This line calculates the formatted price (in dollars) based on the price value.
The formatPrice function (not shown in the code snippet) likely formats the price for display.

const [productColor, setProductColor] = useState(colors[0]);:
This line initializes a state variable called productColor using the useState hook.
It sets the initial value to the first color from the colors array.

const [amount, setAmount] = useState(1);:
Similar to the previous line, this initializes a state variable called amount.
It sets the initial value to 1.

const navigate = useNavigate();:
This line initializes the navigate function using the useNavigate hook.
It allows navigation to different routes within the application.

const { addToCart } = useContext(CartContext);:
This line uses the useContext hook to access the addToCart function from the CartContext.
It provides a way to add products to the shopping cart.

const handleAmount = (e) => { ... }:
This defines an event handler function called handleAmount.
It updates the amount state based on the value selected in an input field.

const cartProduct = { ... }:
This creates an object called cartProduct.
It combines various properties related to the product (e.g., productID, title, price, etc.).

const addToCartHandler = () => { ... }:
This defines an event handler function called addToCartHandler.
It adds the cartProduct to the shopping cart and navigates to the cart page.


-----------COMPONENTS--------

---components/Loading.jsx

The Loading component is designed to display a loading spinner or indicator
 while some content (such as data from an API or a page) is being fetched or processed.

When this component is rendered, it will display a centered loading spinner on the screen.
The spinner indicates that something is happening in the background (e.g., fetching data) and provides visual feedback to the user.
In summary, the Loading component is a simple UI element that shows a loading spinner to keep users informed while waiting for content to load

---components/Navbar.jsx


BsCart3, BsMoonFill, and BsSunFill are icons from the react-icons/bs package.
FaBarsStaggered is an icon from the react-icons/fa6 package.
NavLink is imported from react-router-dom.
NavLinks is a custom component (not shown here) that likely contains navigation links.
CartContext is a context object related to the shopping cart (used for managing cart state).
useContext is a React hook for accessing context values.

Context Usage:
Inside the component, we use the useContext hook to access the CartContext.
Specifically, we extract the numItemsInCart value from the context. This likely represents the number of items currently in the shopping cart.

HTML Markup (JSX):
The component returns JSX (HTML-like syntax) that defines the structure of the navigation bar (<nav>).
The navigation bar has three main sections:

Navbar Start:
Contains the site title (a hidden link with the letter “C” for small screens) and a dropdown menu icon (visible only on small screens).
The dropdown menu icon is represented by the FaBarsStaggered icon.

Navbar Center:
Hidden on small screens (lg:hidden), this section likely contains navigation links (provided by the NavLinks component).

Navbar End:
Contains a link to the shopping cart (<NavLink to="/cart">) with a cart icon (BsCart3) and the number of items in the cart (numItemsInCart).
The cart icon and item count are displayed within a circular badge.

Visual Effect:
When this component is used, it renders a responsive navigation bar with the following elements:
Site title (hidden on small screens).
Dropdown menu icon (visible on small screens).
Navigation links (hidden on small screens).
Shopping cart link with icon and item count.

---components/ProductsGrid.jsx

Purpose:
The ProductsGrid component is responsible for displaying a grid of product cards on a web page.
Each product card contains an image, title, and price.

Data Source:
The component uses the useLoaderData() hook to retrieve product data.
The products variable contains an array of product objects.

Mapping Products:
The component maps over each product in the products array.
For each product, it extracts the title, price, and image properties.

Product Card Structure:
For each product, it creates a clickable link (<Link>) that leads to the product details page (/products/${product.id}).
The link has a card-like appearance with a shadow effect on hover.
Inside the link, there’s a figure containing the product image (displayed as a rounded rectangle).
Below the image, there’s a card body with the product title (capitalized) and price (formatted as dollars).

Visual Effect:
When this component is used, it renders a grid of product cards.
Each card displays an image, title, and price.
Clicking on a card navigates to the detailed view of that product.

---components/ProductsContainer.jsx

The ProductsContainer component manages the display of product information on a web page.
It allows users to switch between grid and list views for product presentation.

Data Retrieval:
The useLoaderData() hook fetches data related to products.
The meta.pagination.total property represents the total number of products available.

Layout State:
The component uses the useState hook to manage the current layout (either “grid” or “list”).
The setLayout function updates the layout state when the user switches views.

View Switch Buttons:
The component displays two buttons: one for grid view and another for list view.
Clicking these buttons updates the layout state accordingly.
The button styles change based on the active layout.

Conditional Rendering:
If there are no products (totalProducts === 0), it displays a message indicating no matching products.
Otherwise, it renders either the ProductsGrid or ProductsList component based on the selected layout.

Visual Effect:
When this component is used, it provides a flexible way to display product information.
Users can toggle between grid and list views to explore products.

------CartContext.jsx

Context Purpose:
The CartContext is a special object in React that allows components to share data related to the shopping cart.
It acts as a global storage for cart-related information.

Use Case:
Imagine you have a shopping website with multiple components (like the cart, product list, and checkout).
Instead of passing cart data through props from parent to child components, you can use the CartContext to make the cart data
 accessible to any component within your app.

How It Works:
You create a CartContext using createContext().
Components that need access to cart data can use the useContext hook to read from or update the cart context.
This simplifies data sharing and management across different parts of your app.


Local Storage Retrieval:
The localStorage is a browser feature that allows us to store data persistently on the user’s device.
In this code, we’re retrieving an item called “cartItems” from local storage.

JSON Parsing:
The localStorage stores data as strings.
We use JSON.parse() to convert the stored string back into a JavaScript object.
The result is assigned to the storedCartItems variable

Dependency Array ([cartItems]
We specify [cartItems] as the dependency array.
This means the effect will run whenever the cartItems array changes (e.g., when items are added or removed from the cart)

useEffect Hook:
The useEffect hook is a special function in React that allows us to perform side effects (such as data fetching or state updates) 
after the component renders.
